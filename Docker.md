  Linux 3 Components -- 1) Hardware 2) Kernel 3) Shell System utiltiy
  
  hard- ram, cpu, harddisk drive
  
  
  shell --> kernel-- hardware

 cd  -- change directory
 ls -- used to obtained list of all filenames in the current directory 
  
  
  
  
  # The Cloud and Linux
   c programming , assembly language, data structure and algorithm
   algorithm is a step by step approach to solve problem a paritcular problem.
   algorithm help to solve problem in minutes.

   Define Linus Kernel.
    The Linux Kernel is a low-level software system. It is used to keep track of resouces and give a user interface.

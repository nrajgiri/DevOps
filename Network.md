# SSL -- Secure Soket Layer 
2 entites want to communcate and they want to communicate in secure enviroment 

auth, confidential 
if u are sending message to anyone

  - provide secure connection
  - they must authencate each other (two application or network)
  - act as middleman and will retrieve that web page for you.



what is Proxy Server?
server that retrieves data for webpage 
computer understand binary language on or off and 1 or 0

plain test
layer 7
Insecure
light weight

Why are you still using HTTP?

How does HTTPS work? 

https- communication between browser to server.
data need to be encripted and secure
https make encription when request is travelling from browser(client) to web server.
https protocal works 

https just mean it's encripted
but what about other attack sql injection, cross-site scirpting, csrf still accessible and can be performed on any web site .

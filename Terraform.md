install Terraform using HOMEBREW:-
homebrew is package management tools for mac.




Terra-form==> Extra Terrestrial  Activities
- it makes your planet just like earth


if you want to create 500 or 1000 sever.
manualy it very difficult.
we can do by config or infstructure.
TF (terra form) we can define our requirement or dependencies that is required for  apps

IT Infrastructure:-

close the service
 3 teir-- 
 
 1) jbos - app
 2) rds
 3)
 
 
 terraform init --> terraform plan --> terraform apply - terraform destroy
 terraform init- preparing loal files by downloading all the required dependies
 - preparing local enviroment by downloading all the dependies
 
 
 terraform plan - provide update on resource
 
 terra apply - 
 
 ec2
 
 
 
 create instance
 * delete the user once done with cource

=======================================================================
Terraform uses Hashicorp configure language(HCL) 
It is similar ot JSON but easy and human readable.
Terra form is IAC tool. infrastructure as code

Infrastructure as code is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure  through code insteas of
through manual Process.
provisioning- means allocating to sever.

two ways to approach IAC
1) Imperative 2) Declarative
IAC open source:- Terraform, Ansible

Configuration Management tool and IAC tool:

->Ansible, chef, Puppet are configuration Management tool which means they are primarily designed to install and manage software on existing server.
-> Terraform and Cloudformation are IAC  tools which are designed to provision server and infrastructure themselves.

aws console
==========
IAM-> identity  and access Management control who is authenticated and authorized to use use resources
Identitiy and Access Management System:-
---------------------------------------
Shared access to your aws account
Granular Permissions-



Elastic compute Cloud:-
----------------------

provide secure and reseizable(scalable) compute capacity in cloud


cloud computing:-
aws, microsoft azure, gcp
  on demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 

================================================

cloud type
public, private, hybrid, community

saas

deployment model of cloud
public, private, hybrid, community

client server model

EC2 - elastic compute cloud (a virtual server)
you only pay, what you used.
